# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition
This project aims to recognize handwritten digits using MNIST datasets.

# Requirements
* TensorFlow
* Numpy
* PIL ( pillow )
* Opencv
* tkinter

# About Project

* Trained model on MNIST dataset Using CNN

* make a canvas and write the digits using tkinter

* Using PIL get a copy of Handwritten Digits on the canvas and saved into '/img' as 'img_{image_number}.png'

* Also with the help of OpenCV by recognizing contours it can handle multiple digits

* Use saved model 'mnist.h5' to predict saved Handwritten Digit image from canvas
